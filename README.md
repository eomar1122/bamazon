# bamazon

The goal was to create an Amazon-like store front using Node.js and MySQL. 

## How it works? 

- Clone this repository.
- You can run the game by typing this "node bamazonCustomer.js" in the terminal.
- The app will show products table.
- Ask a user to choose the item ID and the quantity of that item.
- Then it will show the total for the transaction and update the database.
- When the use is done, he/she will be asked if wants to do another transaction.
